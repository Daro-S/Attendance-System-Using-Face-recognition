# Attendance System Using Face Recognition

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of **Capstone Project 2** at **Cambodia Academy of Digital Technology (CADT)**. The primary objective of this project is to leverage knowledge in **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to automate and improve the traditional manual attendance system.

## Problem Statement

Manual attendance systems are often time-consuming, prone to errors, and require significant manual effort to maintain records. In educational institutions and organizations, accurate and efficient attendance tracking is crucial. The existing methods, such as roll calls or sign-in sheets, can be inefficient and lead to inaccuracies in attendance records.

## Project Goals

This project aims to design and implement a robust **Attendance System** that uses **Face Recognition Technology** to automate the attendance-taking process. By utilizing computer vision techniques, this system will:

- **Automatically identify** and **recognize faces** of individuals in real-time.
- **Record attendance** accurately without the need for manual intervention.
- **Provide a user-friendly interface** for managing attendance records and generating reports.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Computer Vision**: Utilizes OpenCV and other relevant libraries for face detection and recognition.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Incorporates machine learning models for accurate face recognition.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the application.
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration.

## Implementation Details

1. **Face Detection**: The system detects faces in real-time using a camera or video feed. 
2. **Face Recognition**: Once faces are detected, the system matches them against a database of known faces to identify individuals.
3. **Attendance Logging**: After successful recognition, the system logs the attendance in a database, marking the individual as present.
4. **Report Generation**: The system can generate attendance reports based on the recorded data.

## Project Outcome

The outcome of this project will be a fully functional attendance system that is not only efficient and accurate but also reduces the workload associated with traditional attendance methods. It can be integrated into various educational institutions and organizations, providing a seamless experience in attendance management.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and AI in solving real-world problems. The Attendance System Using Face Recognition is a step towards automating routine tasks and improving the efficiency of organizational processes.
